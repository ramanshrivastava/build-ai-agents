# Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Management Guidelines

## Classification

CKD is classified by cause, GFR category, and albuminuria category:

### GFR Categories

- G1: eGFR >= 90 mL/min/1.73m2 (normal or high)
- G2: eGFR 60-89 (mildly decreased)
- G3a: eGFR 45-59 (mildly to moderately decreased)
- G3b: eGFR 30-44 (moderately to severely decreased)
- G4: eGFR 15-29 (severely decreased)
- G5: eGFR < 15 (kidney failure)

### Albuminuria Categories

- A1: UACR < 30 mg/g (normal to mildly increased)
- A2: UACR 30-300 mg/g (moderately increased, formerly "microalbuminuria")
- A3: UACR > 300 mg/g (severely increased, formerly "macroalbuminuria")

## Monitoring Frequency

For CKD Stage 3 (eGFR 30-59):
- eGFR and UACR: at least every 6 months
- Serum potassium: every 3-6 months
- Serum bicarbonate: every 6 months
- Hemoglobin: annually
- Phosphate, calcium, PTH: annually for Stage 3b, not routinely for Stage 3a

## Medication Adjustments in CKD

### Metformin in CKD

- eGFR >= 45: No adjustment needed
- eGFR 30-45: Maximum dose 1000mg/day. Increase monitoring frequency.
- eGFR < 30: Discontinue metformin

### RAAS Inhibitors (ACE inhibitors/ARBs) in CKD

ACE inhibitors and ARBs are recommended for patients with CKD and albuminuria for renoprotection. Key monitoring:
- Check serum creatinine and potassium 1-2 weeks after initiation or dose change
- Acceptable: up to 30% rise in creatinine after starting (reflects reduced glomerular hyperfiltration)
- Discontinue if creatinine rises more than 30% or potassium exceeds 5.5 mEq/L
- Do not combine ACE inhibitor with ARB

### NSAIDs in CKD

Avoid NSAIDs in patients with eGFR below 60 due to risk of acute kidney injury and further decline in renal function. Use acetaminophen as preferred analgesic.

### Potassium Management

Hyperkalemia risk increases as eGFR declines. For patients with eGFR below 45:
- Monitor potassium every 3-6 months
- Dietary potassium restriction if potassium exceeds 5.0 mEq/L
- Consider potassium binder (patiromer, sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) if recurrent hyperkalemia limits RAAS inhibitor use

## Referral to Nephrology

Refer to nephrologist when:
- eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73m2 (CKD Stage 4-5)
- Rapid decline in eGFR (> 5 mL/min/year)
- Persistent albuminuria (UACR > 300 mg/g)
- Refractory hyperkalemia or metabolic acidosis
- Suspected glomerular disease or systemic cause of CKD

## Cardiovascular Risk in CKD

CKD is an independent cardiovascular risk factor. All patients with CKD Stage 3 or higher should receive:
- Statin therapy (atorvastatin 20-40mg preferred for CKD)
- Blood pressure control to target below 130/80 mmHg
- Assessment for left ventricular hypertrophy
