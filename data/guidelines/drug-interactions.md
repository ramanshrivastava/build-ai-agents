# Common Drug Interactions in Primary Care

## ACE Inhibitors / ARBs + Potassium-Sparing Diuretics

Combining ACE inhibitors (lisinopril, enalapril) or ARBs (losartan, valsartan) with potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene) significantly increases hyperkalemia risk. Monitor serum potassium within 1 week of combination initiation and regularly thereafter. Risk is amplified in patients with CKD (eGFR below 60).

## Metformin + Contrast Dye

Metformin should be temporarily discontinued before iodinated contrast procedures in patients with eGFR below 60 to prevent lactic acidosis. Withhold metformin on the day of the procedure and for 48 hours after. Recheck renal function before restarting.

## Metformin + Renal-Impairing Drugs

Concurrent use of metformin with drugs that reduce renal function (NSAIDs, certain antibiotics like gentamicin, contrast agents) can lead to metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis. Extra vigilance required when eGFR is 30-60 mL/min.

## Statins + CYP3A4 Inhibitors

Atorvastatin and simvastatin are metabolized by CYP3A4. Co-administration with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (clarithromycin, itraconazole, ritonavir, grapefruit juice in large quantities) increases statin levels and risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis. Consider rosuvastatin or pravastatin as alternatives (not CYP3A4 dependent).

## ACE Inhibitors + NSAIDs

NSAIDs reduce the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors and increase the risk of acute kidney injury, especially in volume-depleted patients or those with pre-existing CKD. The combination of ACE inhibitor + NSAID + diuretic ("triple whammy") is particularly dangerous for renal function.

## Amlodipine + Simvastatin

Amlodipine increases simvastatin levels. Simvastatin dose should not exceed 20mg daily when combined with amlodipine. This interaction does not apply to atorvastatin.

## Sulfa Drug Cross-Reactivity

Patients with sulfonamide antibiotic allergy (e.g., sulfamethoxazole) may have cross-reactivity with:
- Thiazide diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone) — low risk but possible
- Sulfonylureas (glipizide, glyburide) — low risk
- Loop diuretics (furosemide) — minimal cross-reactivity

Clinical significance is debated. Most allergists consider the risk low for non-antibiotic sulfonamides, but caution is warranted in patients with severe sulfa allergy history (anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome).
