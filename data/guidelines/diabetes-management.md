# Diabetes Management Guidelines

## Overview

Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from insulin resistance and progressive beta-cell dysfunction. Management requires a comprehensive approach including lifestyle modifications, pharmacologic therapy, and regular monitoring.

## Glycemic Targets

### HbA1c Goals

For most non-pregnant adults with diabetes, a reasonable HbA1c target is below 7.0%. More stringent targets (below 6.5%) may be appropriate for selected patients if achievable without significant hypoglycemia. Less stringent targets (below 8.0%) may be appropriate for patients with limited life expectancy, advanced complications, or extensive comorbidities.

### Self-Monitoring

Patients on insulin or sulfonylureas should perform self-monitoring of blood glucose. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) may be beneficial for patients on multiple daily insulin injections.

## Pharmacologic Therapy

### Metformin

Metformin remains the preferred initial pharmacologic agent for type 2 diabetes due to its efficacy, safety profile, low cost, and potential cardiovascular benefits. Starting dose is typically 500mg once or twice daily, titrated to a maximum of 2000mg daily in divided doses.

Key considerations:
- Gastrointestinal side effects are common initially and may be reduced with extended-release formulations
- Vitamin B12 deficiency may occur with long-term use; periodic monitoring recommended
- Does not cause hypoglycemia when used as monotherapy

### Metformin and Renal Function

Metformin dose adjustment is required based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR):
- eGFR >= 45 mL/min/1.73m2: No dose adjustment needed
- eGFR 30-45 mL/min/1.73m2: Reduce maximum dose to 1000mg daily. Do not initiate metformin in new patients.
- eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73m2: Metformin is contraindicated. Discontinue if eGFR falls below this threshold.

Monitor renal function at least annually in all patients on metformin, and every 3-6 months in patients with eGFR below 60.

### Insulin Therapy

Consider insulin therapy when:
- HbA1c remains above target despite dual or triple oral therapy
- HbA1c is above 10% or blood glucose is above 300 mg/dL at diagnosis
- Patient is symptomatic (polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss)

Basal insulin (glargine, detemir, or degludec) is typically initiated at 10 units or 0.1-0.2 units/kg/day.

## Complications Screening

### Diabetic Nephropathy

Screen for diabetic kidney disease annually with:
- Urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR)
- Serum creatinine and estimated GFR

Patients with diabetes and CKD should receive an ACE inhibitor or ARB (e.g., lisinopril, losartan) for renoprotection, regardless of blood pressure status.

### Diabetic Retinopathy

Dilated eye examination annually for type 2 diabetes patients, starting at diagnosis. More frequent examinations if retinopathy is detected.

### Diabetic Neuropathy

Screen for peripheral neuropathy at diagnosis and annually thereafter using monofilament testing and assessment of ankle reflexes.

## Cardiovascular Risk Management

Patients with diabetes are at elevated cardiovascular risk. Management includes:
- Statin therapy for all patients aged 40-75 with diabetes (moderate-intensity minimum)
- Blood pressure target below 130/80 mmHg for most patients with diabetes
- Aspirin therapy (75-162 mg/day) for secondary prevention in patients with established cardiovascular disease
- SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists with proven cardiovascular benefit for patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease
