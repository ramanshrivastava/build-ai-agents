# Heart Failure and Atrial Fibrillation Management

## Heart Failure Classification

### NYHA Functional Classification

- Class I: No limitation of physical activity
- Class II: Slight limitation; comfortable at rest, symptoms with ordinary activity
- Class III: Marked limitation; comfortable at rest, symptoms with less than ordinary activity
- Class IV: Unable to carry on any physical activity without discomfort; symptoms at rest

### Ejection Fraction Categories

- HFrEF: Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (EF <= 40%)
- HFmrEF: Heart failure with mildly reduced EF (41-49%)
- HFpEF: Heart failure with preserved EF (>= 50%)

## Pharmacologic Therapy for HFrEF

### Guideline-Directed Medical Therapy (GDMT)

Four pillars of HFrEF therapy (initiate all when possible):
1. ACE inhibitor/ARB/ARNI (sacubitril-valsartan preferred if tolerated)
2. Beta-blocker (carvedilol, metoprolol succinate, or bisoprolol)
3. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (spironolactone or eplerenone)
4. SGLT2 inhibitor (dapagliflozin or empagliflozin)

### Diuretics

Loop diuretics (furosemide, bumetanide, torsemide) for volume management. Titrate to achieve euvolemia. Monitor daily weights, electrolytes, and renal function.

## Atrial Fibrillation

### Rate vs Rhythm Control

Rate control is preferred initial strategy for most patients:
- Target resting heart rate below 110 bpm (lenient) or below 80 bpm (strict)
- Beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil) for rate control
- Avoid calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil) in patients with HFrEF

### Anticoagulation

CHA2DS2-VASc score determines anticoagulation need:
- Score 0 (men) or 1 (women): No anticoagulation
- Score 1 (men) or 2 (women): Consider anticoagulation
- Score >= 2 (men) or >= 3 (women): Anticoagulation recommended

DOACs (apixaban, rivarubicin, edoxaban, dabigatran) preferred over warfarin for most patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation.

### AF with Heart Failure

When atrial fibrillation coexists with heart failure:
- Rate control with beta-blocker (avoid calcium channel blockers in HFrEF)
- Amiodarone may be considered for rhythm control if needed
- Digoxin as add-on for rate control if beta-blocker insufficient
- Anticoagulation per CHA2DS2-VASc score (heart failure adds 1 point)

## Monitoring in Heart Failure

- Daily weight monitoring (report gain of more than 2 lbs in 24 hours or 5 lbs in 1 week)
- Serum electrolytes and renal function every 1-2 weeks when titrating medications
- BNP or NT-proBNP for trend monitoring (not for screening)
- Echocardiogram annually or with clinical change
