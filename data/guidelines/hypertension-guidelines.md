# Hypertension Management Guidelines

## Definition and Classification

Hypertension is defined as sustained blood pressure at or above 130/80 mmHg. Classification:
- Normal: systolic below 120 and diastolic below 80 mmHg
- Elevated: systolic 120-129 and diastolic below 80 mmHg
- Stage 1 Hypertension: systolic 130-139 or diastolic 80-89 mmHg
- Stage 2 Hypertension: systolic at or above 140 or diastolic at or above 90 mmHg

## Blood Pressure Targets

### General Population

Target blood pressure below 130/80 mmHg for most adults with confirmed hypertension.

### Patients with Diabetes

Blood pressure target below 130/80 mmHg. ACE inhibitors or ARBs are preferred first-line agents due to renoprotective effects.

### Patients with CKD

Blood pressure target below 130/80 mmHg. ACE inhibitors or ARBs are strongly recommended for patients with albuminuria (UACR above 30 mg/g).

## Pharmacologic Treatment

### First-Line Agents

Four classes of antihypertensives are recommended as first-line therapy:
- ACE inhibitors (e.g., lisinopril, enalapril, ramipril)
- ARBs (e.g., losartan, valsartan, olmesartan)
- Calcium channel blockers (e.g., amlodipine, nifedipine)
- Thiazide diuretics (e.g., chlorthalidone, hydrochlorothiazide)

### Combination Therapy

Most patients with Stage 2 hypertension will require two or more antihypertensive medications. Preferred combinations:
- ACE inhibitor/ARB + calcium channel blocker
- ACE inhibitor/ARB + thiazide diuretic
- Calcium channel blocker + thiazide diuretic

Do NOT combine ACE inhibitors with ARBs (dual RAAS blockade increases risk of hyperkalemia, hypotension, and renal failure).

### Resistant Hypertension

Blood pressure remaining above target despite three antihypertensive agents at optimal doses, one of which should be a diuretic. Consider:
- Adding spironolactone 25-50mg daily
- Evaluating for secondary causes (renal artery stenosis, primary aldosteronism, pheochromocytoma)
- Assessing medication adherence

## Special Considerations

### Hypertension with CKD

- ACE inhibitors or ARBs preferred for renoprotection
- Monitor serum potassium and creatinine within 2-4 weeks of initiating or titrating RAAS inhibitors
- Hyperkalemia risk increases with eGFR below 45 mL/min
- May need to reduce ACE inhibitor/ARB dose or discontinue if potassium exceeds 5.5 mEq/L or creatinine rises more than 30% from baseline

### Hypertension in Elderly

- For patients aged 65 and older, consider starting at lower doses
- Monitor for orthostatic hypotension
- Systolic target below 130 mmHg if tolerated
